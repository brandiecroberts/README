### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces. 

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.
```javascript
const whatToDoForLunch = function(hungry, availableTime) {
  if (hungry === false) {
    console.log('Go back to work!');
  } else if (hungry === true && availableTime < 20) {
    console.log('Grab a snack!');
  } else if (hungry === true && availableTime >= 20 && availableTime <= 30) {
    console.log('Take a break, and cook something yummy!');
  } else {
    console.log('Consider how much time you have to work/eat.');
  }
};
```
